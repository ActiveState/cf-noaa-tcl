cf::NOAA binding for Tcl
===

Requisites
---

 * Google protobuf library.

 * The protobuf-c project at [https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c]

   This consists of two pieces, a compiler/generator application, and
   a supporting generic runtime library.

   The application is only needed to compile/translate .proto files
   into C code. At runtime only the supporting library is needed.

Package files
---

 * log.proto

   Copy of the metron log message format, a protobuf specification.

 * log.c, log.h

   C code generated by the "protobuf-c" compiler/generator.
   Mainly structure definitions (container, and reflective description).
   The implementation simply calls into the generic runtime library of
   "protobuf-c".

 * protobuf-c/

   This has its __own__ LICENSE (BSD 2-clause).
