cf::NOAA binding for Tcl
===

Requisites
---

 * Google protobuf library.

 * The protobuf-c project at [https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c]

   This consists of two pieces, a compiler/generator application, and
   a supporting generic runtime library.

   The application is only needed to compile/translate .proto files
   into C code. At runtime only the supporting library is needed.

 * log.c, log.h
